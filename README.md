# Chemical-Thermodynamics
Chemical engineering thermodynamics utilities packaged as the `chemthermo`
library (src layout, SI units).

## Local install

macOS/Linux (development install):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
```

Windows PowerShell (development install):
```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
```

Non-dev install (wheel/non-editable):
```bash
python -m pip install .
```

Tiny import and data check:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
from chemthermo import Component

methane = Component.from_database("Methane")
print(methane.name, methane.tc_k, methane.pc_pa)
PY
```

## Common issues

- Editable install fails with an old pip: run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` inside the active `.venv`, then retry.
- Build backend errors mentioning setuptools/wheel: run `python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel`, then retry `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bibtexparser.bparser'`: your environment resolved `bibtexparser` 2.x; chemthermo's citation loader uses the 1.x API. Reinstall with a `bibtexparser<2` constraint (the pinned `pyproject.toml` requirement already enforces this for new installs).

## Current API usage

SI units are used throughout (temperature in K, pressure in Pa).
```python
from chemthermo import Component, Composition, Mixture, PengRobinsonEOS, flash_tp

component_names = ("Methane", "Ethane", "Propane")
components = tuple(Component.from_database(name) for name in component_names)
z = (0.50, 0.30, 0.20)  # Mole fractions.

composition = Composition(fractions=z, basis="mole", normalize=False)
mixture = Mixture(components=components, composition=composition)
eos = PengRobinsonEOS()

temperature_K = 240.0
pressure_Pa = 3.0e6

result = flash_tp(
    mixture,
    temperature_K=temperature_K,
    pressure_Pa=pressure_Pa,
    eos=eos,
)
print(result.vapor_fraction)
print(result.phases["liquid"].composition.fractions)
print(result.phases["vapor"].composition.fractions)
```

See `examples/basic/flash_tp_peng_robinson_demo.py` for a runnable script that prints a
table-style summary.

### Automatic phase detection

In phi-phi mode `flash_tp` decides one phase versus two with Michelsen's
tangent-plane stability test, not with Wilson K-value heuristics (ADR-0008):

```
flash_tp -> stability_tp(feed) -> single phase | split seeded from the minimizer
```

- The feed is tested first. A **single-phase** result means the feed was *found
  stable*; `termination_reason` is `"feed_stable_tangent_plane"` and
  `diagnostics["tpd_min"]` records the smallest tangent-plane distance found.
- An **unstable** feed seeds the K-values from the converged stationary point
  (`diagnostics["k_seed"] == "stability"`; the Wilson estimate stays as a
  fallback and is reported as `"wilson"` when it is used), and the existing
  Rachford-Rice / successive-substitution split runs unchanged.
- An **inconclusive** stability analysis raises `ConvergenceError` rather than
  quietly returning one phase.
- Every converged two-phase result reports its own verification residuals:
  `mass_balance_residual`, `fugacity_residual`
  (`max_i |ln(x_i phi_i^L) - ln(y_i phi_i^V)|`) and `delta_g_split_rt`, which
  must be negative for the split to be an improvement on the feed.

```python
from chemthermo import Mixture, PengRobinsonEOS, flash_tp

mixture = Mixture.from_database(("Methane", "n-Pentane"), (0.60, 0.40))
result = flash_tp(mixture, temperature_K=175.0, pressure_Pa=1.778e6, eos=PengRobinsonEOS())

print(result.phase_names())                        # ['liquid', 'vapor']
print(result.vapor_fraction)                       # 0.0792360...
print(result.diagnostics["stability_status"])      # 'unstable'
print(result.diagnostics["tpd_min"])               # -0.04265697...
print(result.diagnostics["delta_g_split_rt"])      # -0.00176661...
```

The legacy behavior stays reachable:

```python
from chemthermo import FlashSettings

legacy = FlashSettings(phase_detection="wilson-heuristic")
```

Runnable demo:

```bash
python examples/basic/flash_tp_auto_phase_demo.py
```

**What this does and does not give you.**

- Converged two-phase results are unchanged: the two paths reach the same
  equilibrium from different seeds and agree to 8.6e-7 relative in vapor
  fraction over the validated grid. Verdicts change only where the heuristic was
  wrong. Over a 175-state Peng-Robinson grid, verdict agreement with `thermo`'s
  `FlashVL` (same `Tc`/`Pc`/`omega`, `kij = 0`) rises from 166/175 to 175/175;
  see validation Cases F-1 and F-2.
- **Two phases at most.** This release returns `liquid` and/or `vapor` only.
- **The converged phases are not re-tested for stability.** A three-phase state
  will still come back as two phases. Phase addition/removal and LLE are the
  next slice.
- `"stable"` means no negative tangent-plane distance was found from the
  deterministic trial set, not a global proof (same bound as `stability_tp`).
- **Gamma-phi is still heuristic.** Its diagnostics say
  `phase_detection == "wilson-heuristic"` and its numbers are unchanged. A
  gamma-phi stability test needs a consistent pure-liquid reference fugacity
  that this package does not yet carry; see ADR-0007 for why building one on the
  current gamma-phi flash would produce a silently wrong tangent plane.
- **Vapor/liquid naming is a convention in two places.** For a single-phase
  result the name is the minimum-Gibbs compressibility root branch; when the
  cubic has a single real root (dense or supercritical fluids) both branches
  coincide and the name is a tie-break, not a phase identification. For a
  two-phase result the phase named `vapor` is the one enriched, relative to the
  feed, in the component with the largest Wilson K over the one with the
  smallest. `EquationOfState` exposes no molar volume, so no density-based
  identification is available; this decides the *name* only, never the verdict
  or the compositions.

### Binary interaction parameters (`kij`)

`PengRobinsonEOS.kij` accepts either a scalar (applied to every `i != j` pair,
never to the diagonal) or a mapping from an unordered pair of component names
to a per-pair value. Names are matched case/whitespace-insensitively; a pair
missing from the mapping defaults to `0.0`.

```python
from chemthermo import Mixture, PengRobinsonEOS, flash_tp

mixture = Mixture.from_database(("Methane", "n-Decane"), (0.50, 0.50))
eos = PengRobinsonEOS(kij={("Methane", "n-Decane"): 0.0411})

result = flash_tp(mixture, temperature_K=350.0, pressure_Pa=3.0e6, eos=eos)
print(result.vapor_fraction)
```

Both orders of a pair (`("A", "B")` and `("B", "A")`) refer to the same value;
giving both with *different* values raises `ModelError`, as does a pair
naming the same component twice. The diagonal is always unaffected by `kij`,
so pure-component fugacities never change with it (this was a bug in earlier
versions -- see ADR-0006). Runnable demo:

```bash
python examples/basic/tp_flash_pr_kij_demo.py
```

### NRTL activity coefficients

`NRTL` implements the standard Renon-Prausnitz equation (AIChE J. 14 (1968)
135) with the index convention `tau[i, j] = tau_ij`, `alpha[i, j] = alpha_ij`
and `G_ij = exp(-alpha_ij tau_ij)`:

```text
S_j = sum_k G_kj x_k                      (column sums)
C_j = sum_k tau_kj G_kj x_k
ln gamma_i = C_i / S_i + sum_j x_j G_ij / S_j * (tau_ij - C_j / S_j)
```

**Correctness note.** Versions before the `nrtl-gibbs-duhem-fix` slice summed
`G` along rows instead of columns and divided the first term term-by-term. The
result was not the composition derivative of any excess Gibbs energy: with
asymmetric parameters it violated the Gibbs-Duhem relation
`sum_i x_i d ln gamma_i = 0` (residuals of order 1e-1) and differed from
`thermo.NRTL` by up to 0.89 in `ln gamma`. The current implementation agrees
with `thermo` to ~9e-16 and satisfies Gibbs-Duhem to ~2e-10 (central
differences, step 1e-6). Symmetric binaries were unaffected, so gamma-phi flash
results with the packaged pairs shifted only slightly (vapor fraction
0.767092 -> 0.764835 for the Methane/Ethane CLI example).

**Packaged parameters are synthetic.** The pairs shipped in
`src/chemthermo/parameters/data/activity/nrtl.json` (Methane/Ethane and
Benzene/Water) are illustrative placeholders so that the gamma-phi path,
`--flash-mode gamma-phi` and the examples run out of the box. They are **not
fitted to data and not taken from any publication**; do not use them for
engineering work. Supply your own:

```python
from chemthermo import NRTL, NRTLParameters

parameters = NRTLParameters.from_pairs(
    [("1-Propanol", "Water", -0.07149, 2.7425, 0.3, 0.3)]
)
model = NRTL(parameters=parameters)
```

A citation-backed published parameter set (Tessier, Brennecke & Stadtherr,
Chem. Eng. Sci. 55 (2000) 1785, Table 1) lives in
`tests/fixtures/nrtl/tessier2000_problem1.json`, deliberately outside the
packaged defaults. Reproduce the paper's Table 2 tangent-plane stationary
points with:

```bash
python examples/validation/07_nrtl_tessier_stationary_points.py
```

## Phase stability (tangent-plane analysis)

`stability_tp` answers "is this feed one phase or more?" at fixed T, P and z
using Michelsen's tangent-plane-distance criterion, independently of `flash_tp`.

```python
from chemthermo import Mixture, PengRobinsonEOS, stability_tp

mixture = Mixture.from_database(("Methane", "Ethane", "Propane"), (0.50, 0.30, 0.20))

result = stability_tp(
    mixture,
    temperature_K=240.0,
    pressure_Pa=3.0e6,
    eos=PengRobinsonEOS(),
)

print(result.status)             # "unstable"
print(result.tpd_min)            # -0.3492770207  (dimensionless, units of RT)
print(result.trial_composition)  # incipient-phase mole fractions w
print(result.k_values)           # w_i / z_i for the incipient phase
```

```bash
python examples/basic/stability_tp_peng_robinson_demo.py
```

### Liquid-liquid stability with an activity model

Pass `activity_model=` instead of `eos=` to test a liquid feed for a
liquid-liquid split. Both phases are liquids with the same pure-liquid
reference state, so that reference cancels and `ln gamma_i` takes the place of
`ln phi_i` in the same tangent-plane distance - no other change.

```python
from chemthermo import Mixture, NRTL, NRTLParameters, stability_tp

# n-butanol / water, NRTL parameters from Tessier, Brennecke & Stadtherr,
# Chem. Eng. Sci. 55 (2000) 1785, Table 1 (pair 2-3).
parameters = NRTLParameters.from_pairs(
    [("n-Butanol", "Water", 0.90047, 3.51307, 0.48, 0.48)]
)
mixture = Mixture.from_database(("n-Butanol", "Water"), (0.10, 0.90))

result = stability_tp(
    mixture,
    temperature_K=298.15,
    pressure_Pa=101325.0,
    activity_model=NRTL(parameters=parameters),
)

print(result.status)             # "unstable"
print(result.tpd_min)            # -0.0299944888
print(result.trial_composition)  # (0.419473, 0.580527) - the incipient phase
```

Runnable demo:

```bash
python examples/basic/stability_tp_nrtl_lle_demo.py
```

Reproduce the published tangent-plane global minima of Tessier et al. (2000)
Problems 1 and 2:

```bash
python examples/validation/08_stability_nrtl_tessier2000.py
```

Notes:
- `status` is `"unstable"` when a trial converges to a stationary point with a
  negative tangent-plane distance, `"stable"` when trials converge and none
  does, and `"inconclusive"` when no trial converges.
- **What "stable" means here:** no negative tangent-plane distance was found
  from the deterministic trial set (for an EOS: two Wilson estimates plus one
  pure-component-dominant estimate per component; for an activity model: the
  pure-component-dominant estimates only). This is *not* a global proof of
  stability; Michelsen's test is a local stationary-point search and a
  stationary point that no initial estimate reaches can hide an instability.
- `tpd_min` is dimensionless (units of RT). At a stationary point it equals
  `-ln(sum_i W_i)`, so `sum(W) > 1` is the instability signal.
- Exactly one of `eos` and `activity_model` must be given. **The combined
  gamma-phi case (activity-coefficient liquid tested against an
  equation-of-state vapor) is not supported** and raises `ModelError`: it needs
  a consistent pure-liquid reference fugacity that this package does not yet
  carry, and returning a plausible-looking wrong tangent plane would be worse
  than refusing. See ADR-0007.
- `pressure_Pa` is required and validated for both families, but it does not
  affect an activity-model result; `result.diagnostics["pressure_dependent"]`
  says which case applies, and `["model_family"]` is `"eos"` or `"activity"`.
- `feed_branch` and `phase_branch` are the minimum-Gibbs compressibility root
  labels for an EOS and are `None` for an activity model (single branch).
  For an EOS, fugacity coefficients for both the feed and every trial are taken
  from the compressibility root with the lowest Gibbs energy at that state.
- Each trial runs successive substitution for `settings.ssi_iterations` (default
  50) and then, if still above `settings.tol`, a damped Newton stage on the
  stationarity condition. Near a plait point successive substitution alone does
  not converge at all; `trial.ssi_iterations`, `trial.second_order_iterations`
  and `trial.converged_stage` record what actually happened.
- `flash_tp` **does** consume this now: in phi-phi mode its single-phase
  decision is this test (see "Automatic phase detection" above, and ADR-0008).
  Gamma-phi still uses the K-bound heuristic.

## CLI usage

Run TP flash without writing Python:

```bash
chemthermo tp-flash --components Methane,Ethane,Propane --z 0.5,0.3,0.2 --temperature-k 240 --pressure-pa 3000000 --format json
```

Run gamma-phi mode (NRTL liquid activity + Peng-Robinson EOS):

```bash
chemthermo tp-flash --components Methane,Ethane --z 0.5,0.5 --temperature-k 240 --pressure-pa 3000000 --flash-mode gamma-phi --format json
```

Module execution is also supported:

```bash
python -m chemthermo tp-flash --components Methane,Ethane --z 0.5,0.5 --temperature-k 240 --pressure-pa 3000000
```

Notes:
- `--flash-mode` defaults to `phi-phi`; valid choices are `phi-phi` and `gamma-phi`.
- Gamma-phi mode currently uses `NRTL()` for the liquid activity model with the
  packaged **synthetic** pair parameters (see "NRTL activity coefficients").
- NRTL pair coverage is data-dependent; missing pair data returns a runtime validation/model error.

## EOS extension points

The public repo defines a minimal residual-Helmholtz EOS protocol and registry
hooks in `chemthermo.eos`:

```python
from chemthermo.eos import EOSProtocol, list_eos

print(list_eos())
```

`EOSProtocol` requires:
- `num_components()`
- `residual_helmholtz(temperature_K, volume_m3, composition)`

## Scope Policy

VLLE and PC-SAFT are in scope for Chemical-Thermodynamics. No thermodynamic capability class is categorically out of scope; implementation maturity may vary by module and release.
